# Writeups

This repository is for guides and writeups for HackTheBox machines/challenges. Mainly for my own consumption.

I'm attempting to solve these challenges with a slight twist - I'll be trying to avoid third party tools as much as possible, and building my own solutions to complete the levels. Basically if it feels too easy to use a third party tool, or if I don't understand what's going on under the hood, I'll attempt to write my own version instead.

I'm approaching the challenges from a software engineering background. I have an interest in security, but I have no formal training/certifications in this area so maybe that will appeal to those making the same approach to HTB. Or perhaps it'll make me completely ineffective :D

Writeups will be added once the solved challenges/machines are retired from HTB...

If you're coming to HTB for the first time, check out this brief [guide](GETTING_STARTED.md), or check out my [HTB hacking approach](APPROACH.md).
